# pore_stats

## To do:
1. Resistive pulse:
	- Add ability to filter out small extrema (low second derivative)
	- Refine code to differentiate between positive and negative going events
	- 

2. Imaging:
	- Optimize imaging; too slow
	- Refine ability to track particles, determine which history a particle belongs to in each frame
	- 

3. Both:
	- Connect resistive pulse data to imaging data

## 1. Overview
pore_stats is a program for extracting transient events, or sudden deviations from the baseline signal, in time-series data, and was specifically written for analyzing resistive pulse data.

#### Extraction

Single events are detected and extracted automatically, even from signals with drifting or jagged baselines.

#### Analysis

pore_stats can automatically determine the event __amplitude__, __duration__, and __current levels__ for non-constant pulses.
