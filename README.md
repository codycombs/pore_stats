## 1. Overview
pore_stats is a program for extracting transient events, or sudden deviations from the baseline signal, in time-series data, and was specifically written for analyzing resistive pulse data.

#### Extraction

Single events are detected and extracted automatically, even from signals with drifting or jagged baselines.

#### Analysis

pore_stats can automatically determine the event __amplitude__, __duration__, and __current levels__ for non-constant pulses.
