## To do:
1. Resistive pulse:
	- Add ability to filter out small extrema (low second derivative)
	- Refine code to differentiate between positive and negative going events
	- 

2. Imaging:
	- Optimize imaging; too slow
	- Refine ability to track particles, determine which history a particle belongs to in each frame
	- 

3. Both:
	- Connect resistive pulse data to imaging data



## GUI and Deployment:
- PyQt
- pyinstaller for deployment
